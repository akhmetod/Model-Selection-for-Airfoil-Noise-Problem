# Model-Selection-for-Airfoil-Noise-Problem
In this project I'm going to justify theoretically and empirically which model will be the best to predict the noise of an airfoil.
I have developed three models a multilinear regression model, a multilayer-perceptron (neural network) and the k-nearest-neighbors 
algorithm. To implement practically the models I have used R as programming language and the librarys Boruta,Neuralnet and FNN.
